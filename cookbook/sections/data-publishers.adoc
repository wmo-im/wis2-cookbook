=== Validate a WIS2 Notification Message

A https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message[WIS2 Notification Message] provides a http://schemas.wmo.int/wnm[JSON Schema] which can be used by any programming language that supports JSON and JSON Schema validation.

.Using Python and check-jsonschema
[source,bash]
----
# install check-jsonschema Python Package from the Python Package Index (PyPI)
pip3 install check-jsonschema

# download WNM schema
curl -O http://schemas.wmo.int/wnm/1.0.0/schemas/wis2-notification-message-bundled.json

# run schema validation
check-jsonschema --schemafile wis2-notification-message-bundled.json /path/to/my/wnm.json
----

The https://github.com/wmo-im/pywis-pubsub[pywis-pubsub] tool provides a test suite to validate a message against the WNM specification requirements, as well as a Python API for application integration.  Consult the pywis-pubsub README on GitHub for more information/examples.

.Using pywis-pubsub
[source,bash]
----
# install pywis-pubsub
pip3 install pywis-pubsub

# sync WIS2 notification schema
pywis-pubsub schema sync

# validate WNM against abstract test suite (file on disk)
pywis-pubsub ets validate /path/to/file.json

# validate WNM against abstract test suite (URL)
pywis-pubsub ets validate https://example.org/path/to/file.json

=== Publish a WIS2 Notification Message with access control

Recommended data in WIS2 may be open or access controlled.  For data publication with access control implications, WNM provides a `security` object as part a link object.  The `security` object is defined using https://swagger.io/specification/#security-scheme-object[OpenAPI Security Scheme definitions].

.Access control using HTTP Basic authentication
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel": "canonical",
  "type": "application/grib2",
  "href": "https://example.org/my/protected/data/nwp/12/003/20240805120000-air-temp-500.grib2",
  "security": {
    "default": {
      "type": "http",
      "scheme": "basic",
      "description": "Please contact us for access information"
    }
  }
}
----

.Access control using an API key
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel": "canonical",
  "type": "application/geo+json",
  "href": "https://example.org/my/protected/data/nwp/12/003/20240805120000-air-temp-500.grib2",
  "security": {
    "default": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "name": "api-key",
      "in": "query",
      "description": "Please see https://example.org/contact-us for more information"
    }
  }
}
----

Note:

* the child propery under `security` (`default` in the examples above) can be any text or label.  We use `default` here as a convention
* the `security.default.name` is the name of the API key parameter as defined by your API service
* only properties defined in the OpenAPI Security Scheme defintion are allowed.  Any additional properties will invalidate the WNM

Of course, always ensure your WNM is valid (see <<Validate a WIS2 Notification Message>> for more information).

=== Validate a WMO Core Metadata Profile record

The [pywcmp](https://github.com/wmo-im/pywcmp) tool provides a test suite to validate a message against the WCMP2 specification requirements, as well as a Python API for application integration.  Consult the pywcmp README on GitHub for more information/examples.

.Using pywcmp
[source,bash]
----
# install pywcmp
pip3 install pywcmp

# sync WCMP2 schemas and codelists
pywcmp bundle sync

# validate WCMP2 against abstract test suite (file on disk)
pywcmp ets validate /path/to/file.json

# validate WCMP2 against abstract test suite (URL)
pywcmp ets validate https://example.org/path/to/file.json
----

A WCMP2 record can also be validated using pywcmp "as a service" using the Canadian WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogue, which provides an online validator:

- Navigate to https://wis2-gdc.weather.gc.ca/openapi?f=html
- Navigate to section *pywcmp-wis2-wcmp2-ets*, endpoint `/processes/pywcmp-wis2-wcmp2-ets/execution` (POST)
- Click "Try it out"
- In the section "Mandatory execute request JSON", paste the WCMP2 JSON inside the `record` object

.WIS2 GDC online validator, request
image::images/data-publishers-wcmp2-validate-request.png[WIS2 GDC online validator, request]

- Click "Execute"

.WIS2 GDC online validator, response
image::images/data-publishers-wcmp2-validate-response.png[WIS2 GDC online validator, response]

A response will be provided with validation results.

=== Advertise client side filters for data subscriptions in WCMP2 and WNM

A key concept of a WCMP2 record is "actionable links"; this means being able to access a dataset or data granule
without any further interactions.  For real-time data, a WCMP2 record provides linkages to the WIS2 Global Broker
via the MQTT protocol.  At its core, MQTT has two key components:

- topic: the topic to subscribe to
- message payload: the message provided as part of a notification to a given topic

WIS2 defines the WIS2 Topic Hierarchy (WTH) and WIS2 Notification Message (WNM) standards which provide a standards-based
GeoJSON payload/message.

A typical MQTT link in a WCMP2 document is defined as follows:

.Typical WCMP2 MQTT link
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel"  : "items",
  "type" : "application/geo+json",
  "title": "WIS2 notification service",
  "href" : "mqtts://example.org",
  "channel": "cache/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/synop"
}
----

Given WCMP2, WTH and WNM, a user can subscribe to topics related to data of interest for download and access.

In some cases, a dataset may be organized in a manner which requires additional further "filtering" such that a
data consumer is only interested in a certain subset of the data granules being advertised by a given WNM.  Some examples include (but are not limited to), where a data consumer may be only be interested in:

- surface weather observations from a certain station, or
- numerical weather prediction forecast data for a certain timestep or weather parameter

To implement this behaviour, add additional properties to both WCMP2 and WNM as follows:

==== Example: Surface weather observations

.Surface weather observations: WCMP2 MQTT link with additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel"  : "items",
  "type" : "application/geo+json",
  "title": "Real-time notifications",
  "href" : "mqtts://globalbroker.meteo.fr:8883",
  "channel": "cache/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/synop",
  "properties": {
    "wigos_station_identifier": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "WIGOS station identifier"
    }
  }
}
----

.Surface weather observations: WNM additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "properties": {
    "wigos_station_identifier": "0-20000-0-71628"
}
----

When implemented by a data producer, a data consumer can:

- subscribe to real-time notifications to the given topic
- perform client side filtering by against all incoming WNMs with `properties.wigos_station_identifier = "0-20000-0-71628"`

==== Example: Numerical weather prediction based forecast

.Numerical weather prediction: WCMP2 MQTT link with additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel"  : "items",
  "type" : "application/geo+json",
  "title": "Real-time notifications",
  "href" : "mqtts://globalbroker.meteo.fr:8883",
  "channel": "origin/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/prediction/forecast/medium-range/deterministic/global",
  "properties": {
    "model_run": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "Model run",
       "enum": [
           "00",
           "12"
        ],
        "example": "00"
    },
    "forecast_hour": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "Forecast hour",
        "example": "004"
    }
  }
}
----

.Numerical weather prediction: WNM additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "properties": {
    "model_run": "00",
    "forecast_hour": "004"
}
----

A data producer would extend WCMP2 and WNM as follows:

- WCMP2: add a link `properties` object for MQTT links, where each key of the link `properties` object is a https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object#properties[JSON Schema property definition]
- WNM: add additional properties (key: value pairs) in the `properties` object as desired

When implemented by a data producer, a data consumer can:

- subscribe to real-time notifications to the given topic
- perform client side filtering against all incoming WNMs with `properties.model_run = "00" and properties.forecast_hour = "004"`

A sample Python script can be found below.  The script connects to the Météo-France Global Broker, subscribed to weather notifications
from Environment and Climate Change Canada, Meteorological Service of Canada.  The script then performs client side filtering by
evaluating (for each WNM) the `properties.wigos_station_identifier` value to match a particular station (`0-20000-0-71628`).

=== Defining and proposing topic for WMO Earth system disciplines

The https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-topic-hierarchy/standard/wis2-topic-hierarchy-STABLE.html[WIS2 Topic Hierarchy] describes the topic structure and levels to be used when publishing WIS2 notification messages.

The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines to domain experts so that the Topic Hierarchy definition is consistent and useful to address the needs of WIS2 users.

==== Core levels

Core topics are defined in the first 7 levels and address all Earth system disciplines in a consistent manner.

.Core topic examples:
*cache/a/wis2/ma-marocmeteo/core/data/weather*
*origin/a/wis2/de-dwd/core/data/ocean*
*cache/a/wis2/jp-jma/core/data/weather

The Earth system disciplines https://codes.wmo.int/wis/topic-hierarchy/_earth-system-discipline[defined] by WTH are as follows:

* `atmospheric-composition`
* `climate`
* `cryosphere`
* `hydrology`
* `ocean`
* `space-weather`
* `weather`

Topics within earch Earth system discipline are then defined by domain experts, reviewed, approved, and published by WMO.

==== Additional Earth domain specific topics levels

===== What is the use of the Topic Hierarchy ?

The definition of the Topic Hierarchy is heavily linked to the use of Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) protocols, here MQTT[S], in WIS2. Users, when subscribing to the Global Broker, can decide which notification messages they wish to receive.

===== MQTT wildcards

For example, connecting to a Global Broker and subscribing to:

``cache/a/wis2/+/core/data/weather/surface-weather-observation/synop``

users will receive a notification when a new synop is made available from *any* centre-id publishing message on WIS2.  The `+` character is a single level wildcard for MQTT subscription.

A usder can also choose to subscribe to:

``cache/a/wis2/de-dwd/core/data/weather/#``

In this case, users will receive notification messages from the `de-dwd` centre-id for *all* weather data.  The `#` character is a multiple level wildcard for MQTT subscription, and can only be used at the end of a topic subscription.

By using `+` and `#` (the two defined wildcards in the MQTT[S] protocol), users can extend their subscription and receive all messages they need.

The purpose of additional topic hierarchy levels is to allow users to get the messages they need and to be more specific in their request.

==== Dos and don'ts when defining Earth system discipline topics

*Define only a _small number_ of additional levels*

According the the MQTT[S] protocol specification, the accepted length of a given topic is more than 65kB.  This means that the number of levels can be extremely large.  However, as explained in https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/advanced-features-of-mqtt-topics:

_Try not to use more topic levels “just because I can”. For example, `my-home/room1/data` is a better choice than `my/home/room1/data`._

By default, some MQTT brokers are configured to accept a maximum of 10 levels. This can be changed in the configuration of the broker, however, this limit shows that a usable, practical topic structure should not be too deep (i.e. with a large number of levels).

For WIS2, and considering the various Earth system disciplines, a limit of *4* sublevels seems appropriate.

*Do not use the topic as a metadata record*

When defining the topic, experts must focus on the needs of users.  The purpose of the WIS2 Topic Hierarchy is *not* to describe as precisely as possible what data users will obtain if they decide to subscribe and then download.  Rather, it is _only_ to provide a filtering mechanism so that users will not be flooded by WIS2 Notification Messages that may not be useful for them.

In WIS2, all datasets *must* be described using the https://wmo-im.github.io/wcmp2/standard/wcmp2-STABLE.html[WMO Core Metadata Profile version 2(WCMP2)].  Users will be able to discover the data they need by searching the WIS2 catalogue using (via search engines, directly, or from portals and applications).  The topic hierarchy information will be part of the metadata record for data which provides real-time notifications of publication.

*Do not allow locally defined sublevels outside the `experimental` topic

Each Earth system discipline provides an `experimental` topic.  For example, for `weather`, the first additional levels in the domain topic hierarchy are:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Name|Description
|`advisories-warnings`
|Advisories and warnings

|`aviation`
|Aviation

|`prediction`
|Data sets produced by quantitative algorithms, such as numerical or statistical prediction models, describing the past, present and future meteorological states

|`space-based-observations`
|Space based observations

|`surface-based-observations`
|Surface based observations
|`experimental`
|Experimental topics
|===

As the name suggests, `experimental` allows for defining additional topics for tests and experiments.  This is not meant to be used for operational data exchange.  It should only be used for testing purposes.

With the exclusion of the `experimental` topic level, the topic Hierarchy must be _fully_ defined for each Earth system discipline.

In some situations, it might be tempting for a data producer to use additional topic levels to restrict even more the number of messages received by the users. 

This is *forbidden*. 

In each Earth system discipline community, all WIS Centres will be able to use the entire topic hierarchy of the domain if they provide data corresponding to each topic. A WIS Centre will not be allowed to add additional sublevels or undefined level within the Topic Hierarchy for its own needs.

Modification of the Topic Hierarchy will be possible by using the WMO fast-track approval process.

*Consider users needs and prevent complex wildcard subscriptions*

The purpose of the WIS2 Topic Hierarchy is to inform users about the availability of new data. In WIS2, obtaining data will start, in most cases, by configuring one or more subscription to topics, as defined in the associated WCMP2 discovery metadata records, so that users will receive notifications when new data is available.

The Topic Hierarchy should be defined so that users will not need to configure a very large number of different subscriptions to get the data they are interested in. 

Each level in the WIS2 Topic Hierarchy should be seen as a "logical" group (as the Earth system disciplines `weather`, `ocean`... or like `synop` for `surface-based-observations`).

Then, and considering that wildcard subscription (using `+`and `#` as described above), are "expensive" to manage for the brokers.

For example, a topic hierarchy resulting in users subscribing to:

``cache/a/wis2/+/core/data/ocean/+/some/+/thing/+/else/#``

should be avoided. A subscription to the following topic:

``cache/a/wis2/+/core/data/ocean/some/thing/else/#``

is much more effective for both the client and the broker side.

If it is likely that most users will use wildcards for particular topic levels, then, either removing that level altogether, of moving that level a the end of the topic hierarchy is also more efficient for clients and producers.

If most users end up subscribing to:

``cache/a/wis2/+/core/data/ocean/+/thing/+/#``

then, the Topic Hierarchy could be reconsidered, so that the above subscription can be replaced by:

``cache/a/wis2/+/core/data/ocean/thing/#``

Reordering the levels of topics and potentially reducing the number of sublevels makes the topic hierarchy simpler and more efficient.

*Facilitate client side filtering*

Notification messages are small pieces of information.  MQTT[S] broker and clients are able to handle a very large number of messages.  In that sense, receiving, potentially, too many messages is not a problem. However, downloading data, depending on the size of the data might be slower and less efficient.  If, for a particular dataset, the geometry information available in the notification message is not sufficient to allow client-side filtering before download, it is suggested to provide additional information in the `properties` object of the notification message so that users can decide _before_ downloading if the data in this particular messsage is useful for them.

See <<_advertise_client_side_filters_for_data_subscriptions_in_wcmp2_and_wnm>> for more information on client side filtering
