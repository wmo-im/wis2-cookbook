=== Validate a WIS2 Notification Message

A https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message[WIS2 Notification Message] provides a http://schemas.wmo.int/wnm[JSON Schema] which can be used by any programming language that supports JSON and JSON Schema validation.

.Using Python and check-jsonschema
[source,bash]
----
# install check-jsonschema Python Package from the Python Package Index (PyPI)
pip3 install check-jsonschema

# download WNM schema
curl -O http://schemas.wmo.int/wnm/1.0.0/schemas/wis2-notification-message-bundled.json

# run schema validation
check-jsonschema --schemafile wis2-notification-message-bundled.json /path/to/my/wnm.json
----

The https://github.com/wmo-im/pywis-pubsub[pywis-pubsub] tool provides a test suite to validate a message against the WNM specification requirements, as well as a Python API for application integration.  Consult the pywis-pubsub README on GitHub for more information/examples.

.Using pywis-pubsub
[source,bash]
----
# install pywis-pubsub
pip3 install pywis-pubsub

# sync WIS2 notification schema
pywis-pubsub schema sync

# validate WNM against abstract test suite (file on disk)
pywis-pubsub ets validate /path/to/file.json

# validate WNM against abstract test suite (URL)
pywis-pubsub ets validate https://example.org/path/to/file.json
----

=== Publish a WIS2 Notification Message with access control

Recommended data in WIS2 may be open or access controlled.  For data publication with access control implications, WNM provides a `security` object as part a link object.  The `security` object is defined using https://swagger.io/specification/#security-scheme-object[OpenAPI Security Scheme definitions].

.Access control using HTTP Basic authentication
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel": "canonical",
  "type": "application/grib2",
  "href": "https://example.org/my/protected/data/nwp/12/003/20240805120000-air-temp-500.grib2",
  "security": {
    "default": {
      "type": "http",
      "scheme": "basic",
      "description": "Please contact us for access information"
    }
  }
}
----

.Access control using an API key
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel": "canonical",
  "type": "application/geo+json",
  "href": "https://example.org/my/protected/data/nwp/12/003/20240805120000-air-temp-500.grib2",
  "security": {
    "default": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "name": "api-key",
      "in": "query",
      "description": "Please see https://example.org/contact-us for more information"
    }
  }
}
----

Note:

* the child propery under `security` (`default` in the examples above) can be any text or label.  We use `default` here as a convention
* the `security.default.name` is the name of the API key parameter as defined by your API service
* only properties defined in the OpenAPI Security Scheme defintion are allowed.  Any additional properties will invalidate the WNM

Of course, always ensure your WNM is valid (see <<Validate a WIS2 Notification Message>> for more information).

=== Validate a WMO Core Metadata Profile record

The [pywcmp](https://github.com/wmo-im/pywcmp) tool provides a test suite to validate a message against the WCMP2 specification requirements, as well as a Python API for application integration.  Consult the pywcmp README on GitHub for more information/examples.

.Using pywcmp
[source,bash]
----
# install pywcmp
pip3 install pywcmp

# sync WCMP2 schemas and codelists
pywcmp bundle sync

# validate WCMP2 against abstract test suite (file on disk)
pywcmp ets validate /path/to/file.json

# validate WCMP2 against abstract test suite (URL)
pywcmp ets validate https://example.org/path/to/file.json
----

A WCMP2 record can also be validated using pywcmp "as a service" using the Canadian WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogue, which provides an online validator:

- Navigate to https://wis2-gdc.weather.gc.ca/openapi?f=html
- Navigate to section *pywcmp-wis2-wcmp2-ets*, endpoint `/processes/pywcmp-wis2-wcmp2-ets/execution` (POST)
- Click "Try it out"
- In the section "Mandatory execute request JSON", paste the WCMP2 JSON inside the `record` object

.WIS2 GDC online validator, request
image::images/data-publishers-wcmp2-validate-request.png[WIS2 GDC online validator, request]

- Click "Execute"

.WIS2 GDC online validator, response
image::images/data-publishers-wcmp2-validate-response.png[WIS2 GDC online validator, response]

A response will be provided with validation results.

=== Advertise client side filters for data subscriptions in WCMP2 and WNM

A key concept of a WCMP2 record is "actionable links"; this means being able to access a dataset or data granule
without any further interactions.  For real-time data, a WCMP2 record provides linkages to the WIS2 Global Broker
via the MQTT protocol.  At its core, MQTT has two key components:

- topic: the topic to subscribe to
- message payload: the message provided as part of a notification to a given topic

WIS2 defines the WIS2 Topic Hierarchy (WTH) and WIS2 Notification Message (WNM) standards which provide a standards-based
GeoJSON payload/message.

A typical MQTT link in a WCMP2 document is defined as follows:

.Typical WCMP2 MQTT link
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel"  : "items",
  "type" : "application/geo+json",
  "title": "WIS2 notification service",
  "href" : "mqtts://example.org",
  "channel": "cache/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/synop"
}
----

Given WCMP2, WTH and WNM, a user can subscribe to topics related to data of interest for download and access.

In some cases, a dataset may be organized in a manner which requires additional further "filtering" such that a
data consumer is only interested in a certain subset of the data granules being advertised by a given WNM.  Some examples include (but are not limited to), where a data consumer may be only be interested in:

- surface weather observations from a certain station, or
- numerical weather prediction forecast data for a certain timestep or weather parameter

To implement this behaviour, add additional properties to both WCMP2 and WNM as follows:

==== Example: Surface weather observations

.Surface weather observations: WCMP2 MQTT link with additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel"  : "items",
  "type" : "application/geo+json",
  "title": "Real-time notifications",
  "href" : "mqtts://globalbroker.meteo.fr:8883",
  "channel": "cache/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/synop",
  "properties": {
    "wigos_station_identifier": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "WIGOS station identifier"
    }
  }
}
----

.Surface weather observations: WNM additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "properties": {
    "wigos_station_identifier": "0-20000-0-71628"
}
----

When implemented by a data producer, a data consumer can:

- subscribe to real-time notifications to the given topic
- perform client side filtering by against all incoming WNMs with `properties.wigos_station_identifier = "0-20000-0-71628"`

==== Example: Numerical weather prediction based forecast

.Numerical weather prediction: WCMP2 MQTT link with additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel"  : "items",
  "type" : "application/geo+json",
  "title": "Real-time notifications",
  "href" : "mqtts://globalbroker.meteo.fr:8883",
  "channel": "origin/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/prediction/forecast/medium-range/deterministic/global",
  "properties": {
    "model_run": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "Model run",
       "enum": [
           "00",
           "12"
        ],
        "example": "00"
    },
    "forecast_hour": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "Forecast hour",
        "example": "004"
    }
  }
}
----

.Numerical weather prediction: WNM additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "properties": {
    "model_run": "00",
    "forecast_hour": "004"
}
----

A data producer would extend WCMP2 and WNM as follows:

- WCMP2: add a link `properties` object for MQTT links, where each key of the link `properties` object is a https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object#properties[JSON Schema property definition]
- WNM: add additional properties (key: value pairs) in the `properties` object as desired

When implemented by a data producer, a data consumer can:

- subscribe to real-time notifications to the given topic
- perform client side filtering against all incoming WNMs with `properties.model_run = "00" and properties.forecast_hour = "004"`

A sample Python script can be found below.  The script connects to the Météo-France Global Broker, subscribed to weather notifications
from Environment and Climate Change Canada, Meteorological Service of Canada.  The script then performs client side filtering by
evaluating (for each WNM) the `properties.wigos_station_identifier` value to match a particular station (`0-20000-0-71628`).
