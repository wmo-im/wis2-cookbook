== Recipes for data publishers

=== Validating a WIS2 Notification Message

A https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message[WIS2 Notification Message] provides a http://schemas.wmo.int/wnm[JSON Schema] which can be used by any programming language that supports JSON and JSON Schema validation.

.Using Python and check-jsonschema
[source,bash]
----
# install check-jsonschema Python Package from the Python Package Index (PyPI)
pip3 install check-jsonschema

# download WNM schema
curl -O http://schemas.wmo.int/wnm/1.1.0/schemas/wis2-notification-message-bundled.json

# run schema validation
check-jsonschema --schemafile wis2-notification-message-bundled.json /path/to/my/wnm.json
----

The https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/pywis-pubsub[pywis-pubsub] tool provides a test suite to validate a message against the WNM specification requirements, as well as a Python API for application integration.  Consult the pywis-pubsub README on GitHub for more information/examples.

.Using pywis-pubsub
[source,bash]
----
# install pywis-pubsub
pip3 install pywis-pubsub

# sync WIS2 notification schema
pywis-pubsub schema sync

# validate WNM against abstract test suite (file on disk)
pywis-pubsub ets validate /path/to/file.json

# validate WNM against abstract test suite (URL)
pywis-pubsub ets validate https://example.org/path/to/file.json
----

=== Publishing a WIS2 Notification Message with access control

Recommended data in WIS2 may be open or access controlled.  For data publication with access control implications, WNM provides a `security` object as part a link object.  The `security` object is defined using https://swagger.io/specification/#security-scheme-object[OpenAPI Security Scheme definitions].

.Access control using HTTP Basic authentication
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel": "canonical",
  "type": "application/grib2",
  "href": "https://example.org/my/protected/data/nwp/12/003/20240805120000-air-temp-500.grib2",
  "security": {
    "default": {
      "type": "http",
      "scheme": "basic",
      "description": "Please contact us for access information"
    }
  }
}
----

.Access control using an API key
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel": "canonical",
  "type": "application/geo+json",
  "href": "https://example.org/my/protected/data/nwp/12/003/20240805120000-air-temp-500.grib2",
  "security": {
    "default": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "name": "api-key",
      "in": "query",
      "description": "Please see https://example.org/contact-us for more information"
    }
  }
}
----

Note:

* the child property under `security` (`default` in the examples above) can be any text or label.  We use `default` here as a convention
* the `security.default.name` is the name of the API key parameter as defined by your API service
* only properties defined in the OpenAPI Security Scheme definition are allowed.  Any additional properties will invalidate the WNM

Of course, always ensure your WNM is valid (see <<Validate a WIS2 Notification Message>> for more information).

=== Publishing a WIS2 Notification Message with embedded data

A https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message[WIS2 Notification Message] provides the ability to embed data as part of a notification (see the https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message/standard/wis2-notification-message-STABLE.html#_1_15_properties_content[Properties / Content] section of the specification).

Providing embedded data offers users the ability to access the data without the need to execute the additional step of downloading the data via the actionable link (see the https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message/standard/wis2-notification-message-STABLE.html#_1_16_links[Links] section of the specification).

In some cases, a data publisher also prefer not to publish the corresponding actionable link to infrastructure (e.g. an HTTP or FTP server).

When the data publisher decides to not publish an actionable link and to rely exclusively on the embedded data feature, the data publisher will:

- use `properties.content` object to provide the data
- use `properties.cache=false` to instruct WIS2 Global Cache Services to not cache the data  (note: `properties.cache` is not required for recommended data, since recommended data is not cached by WIS2 Global Caches)
- provide a link object whose `href` results in HTTP 204 (No Content)

To provide an HTTP 204 link, there a couple of options:

**Option 1: configure your web server to provide an endpoint that always returns 204**:

.Nginx example configuration
[source,console]
----
# always return HTTP 204 when accessing /no-content-here
location /no-content-here/ {
  return 204;
}
----

.Apache example configuration
[source,console]
----
# always return HTTP 204 when accessing /no-content-here
Redirect 204 no-content-here
----

which then would result in the link object as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
    "href": "https://example.org/no-content-here",
    "rel": "canonical"
}
----

**Option 2: use a service that provides HTTP responses as a service**.  One such service is the https://http.codes[HTTP Response API], which then would result in the link object as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
    "href": "https://http.codes/204",
    "rel": "canonical"
}
----

.Embedded data example:
[source,json]
----
{
    "id": "31e9d66a-cd83-4174-9429-b932f1abe1be",
    "conformsTo": [
        "http://wis.wmo.int/spec/wnm/1/conf/core"
    ],
    "type": "Feature",
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            6.146255135536194,
            46.223296618227444
        ]
    },
    "properties": {
        "pubtime": "2022-03-20T04:50:18Z",
        "datetime": "2022-03-20T04:45:00Z",
        "integrity": {
            "method": "sha512",
            "value": "A2KNxvks...S8qfSCw=="
        },
        "cache": false,
        "data_id": "dataset/123/data-granule/UANT01_CWAO_200445___15103.bufr4",
        "metadata_id": "urn:wmo:md:ca-eccc-msc:observations.swob",
        "content": {
            "encoding": "utf-8",
            "value": "encoded bytes from the file",
            "size": 457
        }
    },
    "links": [
        {
            "href": "https://http.codes/204",
            "rel": "canonical"
        }
    ]
}
----

For cases of publishing recommended data, the same approaches/example can be used, without the need to set `properties.cache`.

=== Publishing a WIS2 Notification Message for resource deletion

A https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message[WIS2 Notification Message] provides the ability to publish notifications for new, updated or deleted data and metadata (see the https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message/standard/wis2-notification-message-STABLE.html#_1_16_links[Links] section of the specification).

Similar to the <<_publishing_a_wis2_notification_message_with_embedded_data,embedded data Recipe>>, for data or metadata deletions (core or recommended data), a data publisher may not wish to manage or publish the data or metadata link to infrastructure to an HTTP or FTP server.

In this case, a similar strategy can be used to provide an HTTP 204 No Content link, as per the <<_publishing_a_wis2_notification_message_with_embedded_data,embedded data Recipe>>, along with setting `rel=deletion` in the link object.

.Resource deletion example:

            46.223296618227444
        ]
    },
    "properties": {
        "pubtime": "2022-03-20T04:50:18Z",
        "datetime": "2022-03-20T04:45:00Z",
        "integrity": {
            "method": "sha512",
            "value": "A2KNxvks...S8qfSCw=="
        },
        "cache": false,
        "data_id": "dataset/123/data-granule/UANT01_CWAO_200445___15103.bufr4",
        "metadata_id": "urn:wmo:md:ca-eccc-msc:observations.swob"
    },
    "links": [
        {
            "href": "https://http.codes/204",
            "rel": "deletion"
        }
    ]
}
----

=== Publishing a WMO Core Metadata Profile record for retired data

The primary target for WCMP2 records is for real-time or archive data discovery, access and visualization, with the understanding that a dataset (and its associated discovery metadata) is properly managed and kept up to date.  In certain cases, datasets may become unavailable; this could mean that the dataset lifecycle has reached end of life, and/or no longer maintained.

An "end of life" or retired dataset should be independent from its description.  That is, even if a dataset is retired, there is value in having discovery metadata for these datasets, and so the WCMP2 record associated with it should not be deleted from the WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogues.  The FAIR Data Principles (A2) also state that metradata should persist even the data are no longer sustained footnote:[https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a2-metadata-accessible-even-data-no-longer-available/].

To describe a retired dataset in WCMP2, one can use the ``properties.status`` object as per below:

.Describing a retired dataset in WCMP2
[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  "status": {
    "id": "retired",
    "title": "Retired",
    "url": "https://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/-3/mcc/1.0/codelists.xml#MD_ProgressCode_retired"
  }
}
----

The above status is defined by https://www.iso.org/standard/80874.html[ISO 19115-3] as "_item is no longer recommended for use. It has not been superseded by another item_" footnote:[https://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/-3/mcc/1.0/codelists.html].

Another aspect to consider reviewing all links in the WCMP2 record (``links`` object).  For example, MQTT links can be removed, and any links which no longer provide the data can also be removed.  If the data is retired and has alternative access mechanisms (email, web form), these links can be added to the record.

=== Validating a WMO Core Metadata Profile record

The https://github.com/World-Meteorological-Organization/pywcmp[pywcmp] tool provides a test suite to validate a message against the WCMP2 specification requirements, as well as a Python API for application integration.  Consult the pywcmp README on GitHub for more information/examples.

.Using pywcmp for WCMP2 validation
[source,bash]
----
# install pywcmp
pip3 install pywcmp

# sync WCMP2 schemas and codelists
pywcmp bundle sync

# validate WCMP2 against abstract test suite (file on disk)
pywcmp ets validate /path/to/file.json

# validate WCMP2 against abstract test suite (URL)
pywcmp ets validate https://example.org/path/to/file.json
----

A WCMP2 record can also be validated using pywcmp "as a service" using the Canadian and German WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogues, which provide an online validator:

- Navigate to https://wis2-gdc.weather.gc.ca/openapi?f=html or https://wis2.dwd.de/gdc/openapi?f=html
- Navigate to section *pywcmp-wis2-wcmp2-ets*, endpoint `/processes/pywcmp-wis2-wcmp2-ets/execution` (POST)
- Click "Try it out"
- In the section "Mandatory execute request JSON", paste the WCMP2 JSON inside the `record` object

.WIS2 GDC online validator, request via WCMP2 copy/paste
image::images/data-publishers-wcmp2-validate-request-copy-paste.png[WIS2 GDC online validator, request via WCMP2 copy/paste]

Alternatively, the validator service also accepts a URL (if the WCMP2 record is online):

.WIS2 GDC online validator, request via WCMP2 URL
image::images/data-publishers-wcmp2-validate-request-url.png[WIS2 GDC online validator, request via WCMP2 URL]

- Click "Execute"

.WIS2 GDC online validator, response
image::images/data-publishers-wcmp2-validate-response.png[WIS2 GDC online validator, response]

A response will be provided with validation results.

The WCMP2 standard also has https://wmo-im.github.io/wcmp2/kpi/wcmp2-kpi-DRAFT.html[(draft) Key Performance Indicators] that provide quality assessment in support of continuous improvement of WCMP2 records.  pywcmp additionally implements these KPIs using a similar workflow.

.Using pywcmp for WCMP2 quality assessment
[source,bash]
----
# validate WCMP2 against abstract test suite (file on disk)
pywcmp kpi validate /path/to/file.json

# validate WCMP2 against abstract test suite (URL)
pywcmp kpi validate https://example.org/path/to/file.json
----

The KPI check performs actions such as checking for healthy/working links and acronym checks, length of titles and more.  Note that the KPI results do not affect WCMP2 compliance but are suggestions on how to improve your WCMP2 record for better discoverability and use.

The Canadian and German WIS2 Global Discovery Catalogues also provide this functionality online in a similar fashion as the validator.:

.WIS2 GDC quality assessment checker, request via WCMP2 URL
image::images/data-publishers-wcmp2-quality-assess-request-url.png[WIS2 GDC quality assessment checker, request via WCMP2 URL]

.WIS2 GDC quality assessment checker, response
image::images/data-publishers-wcmp2-quality-assess-response.png[WIS2 GDC online quality assessment checker, response]

A response will be provided with quality assessment results (in a similar format to the validation report).

=== Subscribing to GDC reports of WCMP2 validation and quality assessment

When a WIS2 Node publishes a WCMP2 record, GDCs perform validation according to the WCMP2 https://wmo-im.github.io/wcmp2/standard/wcmp2-STABLE.html#_conformance_class_abstract_test_suite_normative[Abstract Test Suite]).  If the record is compliant, a GDC will ingest and publish the record.  In addition, a GDC may provide additional quality assessment testing based on the https://wmo-im.github.io/wcmp2/kpi/wcmp2-kpi-DRAFT.html[(draft) WCMP2 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)].

GDC reports are made available as part of the https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-monitoring-events/standard/wis2-monitoring-events-DRAFT.html[(draft) WIS2 Monitoring Events specification (WME)] and can be found by subscribing to a Global Broker using the topic `monitor/a/wis2/CENTRE_ID`, where:

* `CENTRE_ID` is the centre identifier of the subject of the message

For example, to subscribe to GDC reports on WCMP2 records published by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), one would subscribe to the topic `monitor/a/wis2/jp-jma`.

Message payloads are based on WME Message Encoding (WMEM), with a `data` payload of the WCMP2 ETS/KPI reports.

// TODO: fix image once WME topic structure is updated and implemented
// .WIS2 subscription to GDC reports of WCMP2 validation and quality assessment
// image::images/data-publishers-monitor-gdc-wcmp2-reports.png[WIS2 subscription to GDC reports of WCMP2 validation and quality assessment]

=== Advertising client side filters for data subscriptions in WCMP2 and WNM

A key concept of a WCMP2 record is "actionable links"; this means being able to access a dataset or data granule
without any further interactions.  For real-time data, a WCMP2 record provides linkages to the WIS2 Global Broker
via the MQTT protocol.  At its core, MQTT has two key components:

- topic: the topic to subscribe to
- message payload: the message provided as part of a notification to a given topic

WIS2 defines the WIS2 Topic Hierarchy (WTH) and WIS2 Notification Message (WNM) standards which provide a standards-based
GeoJSON payload/message.

A typical MQTT link in a WCMP2 document is defined as follows:

.Typical WCMP2 MQTT link
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel"  : "items",
  "type" : "application/geo+json",
  "title": "WIS2 notification service",
  "href" : "mqtts://example.org",
  "channel": "cache/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/synop"
}
----

Given WCMP2, WTH and WNM, a user can subscribe to topics related to data of interest for download and access.

In some cases, a dataset may be organized in a manner which requires additional further "filtering" such that a
data consumer is only interested in a certain subset of the data granules being advertised by a given WNM.  Some examples include (but are not limited to), where a data consumer may be only be interested in:

- surface weather observations from a certain station, or
- numerical weather prediction forecast data for a certain timestep or weather parameter

To implement this behaviour, add additional properties to both WCMP2 and WNM as follows:

==== Example: Surface weather observations

.Surface weather observations: WCMP2 MQTT link with additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel"  : "items",
  "type" : "application/geo+json",
  "title": "Real-time notifications",
  "href" : "mqtts://globalbroker.meteo.fr:8883",
  "channel": "cache/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/synop",
  "properties": {
    "wigos_station_identifier": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "WIGOS station identifier"
    }
  }
}
----

.Surface weather observations: WNM additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "properties": {
    "wigos_station_identifier": "0-20000-0-71628"
  }
}
----

When implemented by a data producer, a data consumer can:

- subscribe to real-time notifications to the given topic
- perform client side filtering by against all incoming WNMs with `properties.wigos_station_identifier = "0-20000-0-71628"`

==== Example: Numerical weather prediction based forecast

.Numerical weather prediction: WCMP2 MQTT link with additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "rel"  : "items",
  "type" : "application/geo+json",
  "title": "Real-time notifications",
  "href" : "mqtts://globalbroker.meteo.fr:8883",
  "channel": "origin/a/wis2/ca-eccc-msc/data/core/weather/prediction/forecast/medium-range/deterministic/global",
  "properties": {
    "model_run": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "Model run",
       "enum": [
           "00",
           "12"
        ],
        "example": "00"
    },
    "forecast_hour": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "Forecast hour",
        "example": "004"
    }
  }
}
----

.Numerical weather prediction: WNM additional properties
[source,json]
----
{
  "properties": {
    "model_run": "00",
    "forecast_hour": "004"
  }
}
----

A data producer would extend WCMP2 and WNM as follows:

- WCMP2: add a link `properties` object for MQTT links, where each key of the link `properties` object is a https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object#properties[JSON Schema property definition]
- WNM: add additional properties (key: value pairs) in the `properties` object as desired

When implemented by a data producer, a data consumer can:

- subscribe to real-time notifications to the given topic
- perform client side filtering against all incoming WNMs with `properties.model_run = "00" and properties.forecast_hour = "004"`

A sample Python script can be found below.  The script connects to the Météo-France Global Broker, subscribed to weather notifications
from Environment and Climate Change Canada, Meteorological Service of Canada.  The script then performs client side filtering by
evaluating (for each WNM) the `properties.wigos_station_identifier` value to match a particular station (`0-20000-0-71628`).

===== System overview

====== System Context

The WIS 2.0 Node will be available to receive data from the upstream data production system, and to serve these data via the Internet to the WIS 2.0 environment.

The WIS 2.0 Node will be available to receive metadata and to serve these metadata via the Internet to the WIS 2.0 environment.

WIS 2.0 Global Brokers will subscribe to the WIS 2.0 Node, and will receive publication messages when data and metadata become available.

*WIS 2.0 Node*

. Selected core and recommended data from upstream systems

. Notification messages to WIS 2.0 Global Brokers

. Selected core data to WIS 2.0 Global Caches

. Subscription messages from WIS 2.0 Global Brokers

. Remaining core data and recommended data to WIS 2.0 end users

.WIS 2.0 Node context diagram
image::images/wis2node-context-diagram.jpg[WIS 2.0 Node context diagram, width=800]

====== External Interfaces

As identified in the context diagram above, the WIS 2.0 Node will have external interfaces with WIS 2.0 Global Brokers, and WIS 2.0 Global Caches. In each case, the communications will be via the Internet.

The Global Brokers will subscribe to the MQTT broker on the Node. This will be done using the standard MQTT secure port, 8883.

The Global Caches will retrieve core data from the Node by accessing the HTTP server on the Node.

End users will retrieve core data not retained by the Global Caches from the Node by accessing the HTTP server on the Node. End users will also retrieve recommended data from the Node by accessing the HTTP server on the Node, subject to appropriate access control.

====== Concepts and Constraints

The WIS 2.0 Node will be compliant with the Manual on WMO Information System Volume II. WMO Information System 2.0 ++[++AD-0++]++.

===== User requirements

The purpose of the WIS 2.0 Node (hereafter, referred to as the Node) is to be available to receive data from the production system, and to serve these data via the Internet to the WIS 2.0 environment.

In order to reach this target, the following high-level user requirements need to be fulfilled:

*_USR-0001_*

The Node shall comply with the specification given in the Manual on WMO Information System Volume II. WMO Information System 2.0, ++[++AD-0++]++.

*_USR-0101_*

The WIS 2.0 Node shall include an MQTT broker, using MQTT 5.0 (hereafter, referred to as the Broker).

*_USR-0150_*

The Broker included in the Node shall be accessible via MQTT protocol over the Internet.

*_USR-0201_*

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF A WIS NODE

3.6.1 General

3.6.1.1 A WIS Node is the component that enables an NC or DCPC to publish their data and discovery metadata via WIS.

3.6.1.2 See also 3.3 (Functional requirements of an NC) and 3.4 (Functional requirements of a DCPC).

3.6.2 Provide access to data and discovery metadata

3.6.2.1 A WIS Node shall provide access to data in accordance with the WMO Unified Data Policy (Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext-2021)).

3.6.2.2 A WIS Node shall allow one or more Global Caches to access and download core data it publishes for real-time and near real-time exchange. Global Caches provide highly available access to copies of these resources.

3.6.2.3 A WIS Node may restrict access to its core data, relying on Global Caches providing access to data consumers.

3.6.2.4 A WIS Node may provide access to data using a Web-based Application Programming Interface (API).

3.6.2.5 A WIS Node shall provide access to discovery metadata describing the data it makes available and how that data can be accessed. Discovery metadata from a WIS Node is added to the Global Discovery Catalogue to create a consolidated view of data available from all WIS Nodes.

3.6.2.6 A WIS Node shall have the capability to publish notifications via a Message Broker.

3.6.2.7 A WIS Node shall publish notifications via its Message Broker about updates to the data and discovery metadata it provides – including the availability of new data, changes to discovery metadata, and removal of a data set from WIS.

3.6.2.8 A WIS Node shall use a standardized topic structure when publishing notifications. Note: More information on the standardized topic structure is provided in the Guidance on technical specifications of WIS 2.0.

3.6.2.9 A WIS Node shall allow one or more Global Brokers to subscribe to notifications published via its Message Broker. Global Brokers provide highly available distribution of notifications published by a WIS Node.

3.6.2.10 See also 4.3 (WIS-TechSpec-2: Publishing data and discovery metadata).

Note: More information on the function and implementation of a WIS Node is provided in the Guidance on technical specifications of WIS 2.0.

3.6.3 Monitor performance of a WIS Node

3.6.3.1 Each WIS Node shall contribute to monitoring the performance of WIS.

3.6.3.2 See also 4.7 (WIS-TechSpec-6: Managing operations of the WIS).
