=== Publishing a WMO Core Metadata Profile record with data provenance

Data provenance provides the ability to describe an audit trail for the lifecycle of a given dataset.

In WCMP2, one can provide linkages to provenance information via a dedicated link object.

{
    "rel": "describedBy",
    "type": "text/html",
    "title": "Provenance information for this dataset",
    "href": "https://example.org/dataset1.html"
}
----

As with any WCMP2 link, the URL itself is defined by the data publisher.  The ``describedBy`` attribute (which is an https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[official IANA link relation]) is the signal for identifying data provenance by a user assessing and reviewing dataset history and lineage.
