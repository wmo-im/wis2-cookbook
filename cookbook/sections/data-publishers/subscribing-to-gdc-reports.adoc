=== Subscribing to GDC reports of WCMP2 validation and quality assessment

When a WIS2 Node publishes a WCMP2 record, GDCs perform validation according to the WCMP2 https://wmo-im.github.io/wcmp2/standard/wcmp2-STABLE.html#_conformance_class_abstract_test_suite_normative[Abstract Test Suite]).  If the record is compliant, a GDC will ingest and publish the record.  In addition, a GDC may provide additional quality assessment testing based on the https://wmo-im.github.io/wcmp2/kpi/wcmp2-kpi-DRAFT.html[(draft) WCMP2 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)].

GDC reports are made available by some GDCs in pilot mode as part of the https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-monitoring-events/standard/wis2-monitoring-events-DRAFT.html[(draft) WIS2 Monitoring Events specification (WME)] and can be found by subscribing to a Global Broker using the topic `monitor/a/wis2/CENTRE_ID`, where:

* `CENTRE_ID` is the centre identifier of the subject of the message

For example, to subscribe to GDC reports on WCMP2 records published by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), one would subscribe to the topic `monitor/a/wis2/jp-jma`.

Message payloads are based on WME Message Encoding (WMEM), with a `data` payload of the WCMP2 ETS/KPI reports.
